Python and R can be thought of as two different languages of coding. There are certain packages such as reticulate, that can use interacting information from both R and Python. Reticulate allows you to run a Python session embedded in your R markdown, you can access code chunks created within R in Python and vice versa, and you can translate between R and Python objects when using things such Pandas. For the sake of understanding how reticulate can chat between R and Python, here is a simple example below. 


```{r setup, include=FALSE}

knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

```

Download reticualte so you can communicate between r and python.
```{r}
library(reticulate)

```


Create a dataframe with pandas in python. 
```{python}


import pandas

df = pandas.DataFrame({'qty':[4,8,16], 'candy':['one', 'two', 'three'], 'quality':['eh', 'meh', 'bleh']})

print(df)


```


Viola! Now you can see that data frame in the r interface - thanks reticulate. 
```{r}

py$df


```
